\section{Introduction}
Issue trackers are a commonly used tool along side version control systems such
as git or svn. The tools allow for users or developers to submit a feature
request, bug fix, or even just a question and have it be responded to, resolved,
and even linked to a specific patch that was made to fix a bug. To improve upon
such a system, letting a developer know what files he is likely to need to change
based on the text-body of an issue may help expedite the process of feature
implementation or bug fixing. This turns the task of the developer to think about
exactly where in the code-base he must update, a task of remembering project
layout in his head, into a yes/no problem when given a list of suggested files
to edit; Able to see at a glance and reaffirm with himself which files he should
be working in.

Programming projects on Github are able to use the websites pull request and
issue tracking system, and it is a well-featured issue-tracker at that. Since
github has many users, and many projects that utilize its issue tracker, GHITS
was developed to take advantage of this to provide a file searcher for
issue tracking described here.
